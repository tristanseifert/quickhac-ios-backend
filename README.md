# quickhac-ios-backend
The backend that powers quickhac-ios application, written in beautiful PHP!

Note that some components, files and pieces of information may be omitted to prevent exposing user's data, but all information is present to allow you to run your own instance of this code, if you so wanted to.

## secret.php ##
The observant ones will probably have noticed that a file, secret.php, is missing from the repo. That's because that file holds Secret Thingsâ„¢ that should be of your own implementation, and therefore we've decided not to include it as to not create a possible security issue for our users, and allow you to use your own encryption and stuff. Check secret_prototype.php instead for the method implementations and descriptions.
